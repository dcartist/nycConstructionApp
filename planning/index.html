    <h3>First started</h3>
    <p>I began with finding a dataset from New York City <a href="https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.cityofnewyork.us/rvhx-8trz" target="_blank">DOB Job Application Filings
    </a>. This dataset contains all job applications submitted through the Borough Offices, through eFiling, or through the HUB, which have a "Latest Action Date" since January 1, 2000. </p>
